# hello-world
My first repository.

Hello! My name is Terry and I am from Louisiana, but currently live in Huntsville, Alabama. I have lived in several states (Illinois, Florida, Virginia, and Kentucky) as well as lived overseas in Naples, Italy while serving in the military. Now, in Huntsville, I am employed by a fiber optic management software company called 3-GIS, where I serve as a GIS Solutions Engineer.
